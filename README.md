# text-analysis-holy-books
This project aims to build a machine build perspective on the holy books.
It was triggered by the work of Tom H. C. Anderson on comparing violence of both the Bible and the Quran (1).
It would great to have such ananalysis publicly available, but even more, to be able to extend that analysis in both breadth and depth. Such is the aim of this project.
